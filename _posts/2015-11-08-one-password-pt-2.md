This is the second <a href="https://panossakkos.github.io/tech/2015/11/01/one-passwords.html"
target="blank">iteration</a> of creating a stateless password manager.
The stateless property is valuable because it eliminates the need to install software, or create accounts.
Moreover, there is nothing that an attacker can steal, everything is plain
computations using a secret key, the user's passphrase.
A realization of a stateless password manager could be as simple as a client-only web app.
That way you can build trust with the users, because they can read the javascript
code that it's being executed on their machine.

The first iteration was using a combination of a passphrase and a service tag
as user's input. These two were hashed and mapped to a block of Bitcoin's Block chain.
The mapped block's hash was hashed and the digest was the password.
I quickly realized that there was no reason to use the Block
chain. You can simply hash the two inputs.

<pre style="text-align: left">
password = hash(passphrase + serviceTag)
</pre>

Let's assume that I start using this technique for every service that I need to authenticate against.
In an ideal world all these services are protecting my passwords by not storing them
as plaintext and by gating the login attempts. This ideal world is not even close to
what is happening today and my password computation technique is as weak as the less secure
service that I use it against. Because the less secure service that I'm using
will be attacked and the attacker will get his hands on my plain text password.
Of course my stolen password is not reused anywhere, thanks to the use of the service tag.
However the service tag must be considered common knowledge, which means that the attacker
(let's assume that he knows how I compute my passwords) will brute force the passphrase
and if my passphrase is weak, he will find it in reasonable time.
Let's see if we can mitigate that by adding in the computation what all the service
providers should be doing in their systems in order to protect my password.

The common and effective approach against the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table#Defense_against_rainbow_tables"
target="blank">rainbow table attacks</a> (which are used to brute force hashed passwords)
is to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)" target="blank">salt</a>.
You can imagine a salt as a very strong password that it's appended to the user's password and then hashed.
This breaks the precomputed tables because the attacker has to recompute them for each possible salt value.
We can easily pick this salt from the Block chain, in order to maintain our stateless property.

<pre style="text-align: left">
salt = blockChain[hash(passphrase + serviceTag) modulo bigPrimeBlockHeight].hash
password = hash(passphrase + serviceTag + salt)
</pre>

Also, let's slow down the attacker by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching" target="blank">stretching</a>
the computed password.

<pre style="text-align: left">
salt = blockChain[hash(passphrase + serviceTag) modulo bigPrimeBlockHeight].hash
password = hash(passphrase + serviceTag + salt)

for i = 0, i < keyStretchingIterations, i++
  password = hash(password)
</pre>

Here is the source for SHA256 as the cryptographic hash, 382777 possible salt values and 65000 iterations of stretching:
