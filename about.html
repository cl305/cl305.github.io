## About Me

Born in Saskatoon, Canada, I moved to Durham, North Carolina when I was only one and a half. I currently go to Duke (only 15 minutes away from home) where I am a rising senior studying computer science. I'm passionate about working with big data and iOS development in either the financial or education industries. I'm also a hobbyist photographer (Instagram link below, website coming soon!).
