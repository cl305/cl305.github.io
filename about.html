## About

Thanks for dropping by. I hope that it will not waste your time, but in case it does, at least I tried.
Originally from New Delhi, India, I'm doing my B.Tech in Computer Science from GGSIP University.

But, apart from that, I'm a die hard classic rock fan, coffee addict, who also enjoy messing with hardware, playing football and Lawn Tennis.
In general, my mind can zone out during any form of creative act. Opinions expressed here are mine.
