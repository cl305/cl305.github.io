## About Me

Thanks for stopping by! Hope it's been worthwhile :^). 

Born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, I moved to Durham, NC when I was about 2. I attended Durham School of the Arts for both middle and high school where I concentrated in violin performance. I am currently attending Duke University (Duke's East Campus is only 2 blocks away from my old high school) where I am pursuing a double major in both electrical computer engineering and computer science at the Pratt School of Engineering.
