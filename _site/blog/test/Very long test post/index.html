      	<p>“I am a little nervous, Bob. This is a tremendous honor.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I have to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for blessing me with the talents to play this game, with a family that supports me day-in and day-out. I’m His humble servant right now. I can’t say it enough: how important my faith is to how I play the game and who I am, so– I’m just blessed and I’m thankful for where I am.</p>

<p>I love playing basketball; there’s no doubt about it. It’s something I’ve been doing since– what, mom and dad, two? With Fisher Price goals. My grandma’s here; we were talking about it yesterday. She used to be my commentator. She used to be Bob Fitzgerald for me counting down the scores, I hit a game-winning shot or whatever, and I’d stumble over and give her a high five, stuff like that.</p>

<p>So, from that beginning to be standing here in front of you today, it’s an incredible journey, a lot has gone into it, a lot of great people that I’ve met along the way that have every bit to do with that trophy as I do. And I’m going to try to get through– obviously the people that are here and the people who are watching that have been extremely significant in my journey. But if obviously I don’t get to you and you had a part in it, please understand that…</p>

<p>This hasn’t sunk in at all. I’m on cloud nine for sure. We’re in the middle of a playoff run, and that’s the most important thing. But today’s a celebration for sure, and I want to take the time to really appreciate what this means, and that’s why we’re here. So, I’ll try to explain how I feel the best I can, just bear with me.</p>

<p>I got to start with my wife. We met when we were 14, 15 years old in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the last 7-8 years have been amazing. We’ve both grown into adults, we’ve moved cross country together, started a new life. And you’re my backbone, you allowed me to do what I do, to focus on basketball and my career, and still have a family. The sacrifices you make are unbelievable. And I can’t thank you enough for who you are as a person, how you challenge me, how you inspire me every single day. We have a beautiful daughter, and one on the way; she’s over there smiling at me. I love you so much and I can’t thank you enough for just being there for me day-in and day-out. Whether I have a good game or bad game, we lose we win, I go home thinking things are good. And that’s comforting to know. And I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me. And you deserve a round of applause for sure.</p>

<p>Mom, Dad. They’ve done a great job of explaining it so far, but I think it can’t be understated how much my brother and I and my sister appreciate just who you are. You’re the example for us, and handled a 16-year NBA career and had us three, and you raised us the right way.</p>

<p>Mom, you are our spiritual guidance, a disciplinarian at times, because you were around when Pops was away; obviously if we were in real trouble, he’d come home and take care of business, but– just, the way that you raised us, not taking any slack, obviously we knew sports is important to us in our family, but there are priorities in life. Obviously your faith is first and foremost, how we did in school growing up was important; if we didn’t handle that business, then there were no privileges. I remember sitting at my first middle school game, because I didn’t handle my stuff at home. That’s a pretty embarrassing moment if you go to your first middle school game and you have to tell your team, “Hey fellas, I can’t play tonight; I didn’t do the dishes at home.” And they’re like, “What? What are you t–?”</p>

<p>So, just, that lesson taught me there’s more to life than basketball, and obviously the most important thing is your family and taking care of each other, and loving each other no matter what. And, regardless if I were to play basketball or not, I know you guys love me. Without a shadow of a doubt, you would’ve encouraged me at any path I would’ve taken. So, just thank you so much.</p>

<p>And Pops, you’re the example of what a true professional is on and off the court. I remember a lot of your career. And to be able to follow in your footsteps, it means a lot to me. This is special. I’m really proud of what you were able to do in your career, and I don’t take that for granted at all. A lot of people thought I had it easy with Pops playing in the NBA, but– I’ll get to that part at the end of the road– but it was an interesting journey, and just who you are, you made it okay for me to have family at my age when I started it, and to know that if you take care of your business you’ll be all right. So thank you so much.</p>

<p>Ah man, got tissues?</p>

<p>My brother, Seth, is here. I’m proud of you, man. We had some battles growing up. You challenged me every single day when we’d play one‑on‑one in the backyard. I always joked our games would go on all night, and it would usually end for one of two reasons: one, my mom would come in and say we were disturbing the neighbors, because it was too late and the bouncing ball they would maybe call over and tell us to shut up over there… or two, you would get mad because I was beating you and you’d say I was cheating because I wouldn’t give you a foul call, and you’d take the ball and run in until I said, “All right, you can have that foul, check‑up and top of the key.”</p>

<p>So those battles I’ll never forget. It was a lot of fun. Just seeing you, how you’ve grown and following your career, it’s not easy having an older brother that’s playing in the NBA and obviously a dad that’s done it before both of us. And the way that you’re handling it is impressive. The sky’s the limit for you, keep doing what you’re doing and keep making the family proud.</p>

<p>Sydel, oh, man, the stories I could tell about us growing up. You made me watch all sorts of crazy movies, and stuff that I should not know line for line, but just– I’m really proud of you and the decisions you’ve made growing up, it’s amazing to see. I love being able to just call you joking last night about what song is from what movie and kind of playing that game, and just the stuff that never gets old. It’s really important to me no matter what happens in life. So I love that being the most consistent part of our relationship, and I’m really proud of you, as well.</p>

<p>I keep looking at my notes making sure I don’t forget anybody.</p>

<p>Grandma Candy, I’ll always be your number one; don’t ever forget that. I’ve got a grandma, Grandma Ducky who is probably watching at home right now, my dad’s mom, who– it’s the afternoon, probably East Coast time, she’s probably flipping back and forth between this and the Braves game to check the score because she never misses a game, but I know she’s watching– and I just want to say, I love you, Grandma. And I know Granddaddy Jack is looking down on us and is extremely proud of our family and where we are, and that means a lot to me. So I hope you’re proud, as well. Just I love you.</p>

<p>My boy Bryant Barr. Man, we’ve been through a lot in the last seven, eight years since our freshman year at Davidson. You’re like another brother to me. My best friend who challenges me spiritually, challenges me as a man, and also encourages me and supports me in everything that I do. And I really appreciate that. From the first time we stepped a foot on Davidson’s campus, we had a little shootout, and whoever made the half-court shot didn’t have to pay for dinner at the local pizza joint. Obviously, he won. So we get in the car and go down to the pizza spot and order a bunch of food, and I pull the old “I forgot my wallet” trick, because I obviously lost my wallet from the way to the gym to the pizza spot. So the next meal is on me, my man. We’ve come a long way. Just, thank you for being there. I’m really proud of you, and just the story that we’ve been a part of is amazing and something that we’ll always have with us. Nobody can take it away from us.</p>

<p>I’ve had a lot of coaches that have helped me along the way. Obviously, Coach Kerr, you’re very humble the way that you’ve approached this season. We obviously had a great, talented roster, but there is definitely something to say about what you and your staff have been able to accomplish in leading our group. This is a special year. The way you’ve challenged us from day one to take advantage of the opportunity that was in front of us. We’re still obviously in the middle of this path and this fight, but I speak for my team, but I’ve enjoyed this year more than any other. And, obviously winning has a lot to do with that, but the preparation that you guys have brought every single day, not letting us get complacent, but not letting us get too big of a head about who we are as a team goes a long way. And I think you’re a huge reason why we are here today, so thank you very much for being you and putting together this great staff that’s sitting over here right here.
I could go through every single guy. There is a huge reason why we are successful. So thank you very much to everybody that we see day‑in and day‑out.</p>

<p>Coach Brown, who is my high school coach back in Charlotte, I know he’s watching. Thank you for your encouragement every single day. You got me started, and I appreciate you.</p>

<p>Coach McKillop, from Davidson, man, he’s a big reason why I have the confidence that I do. I have the spirit about basketball and life. And it’s special to know that I could represent the Davidson basketball program up here today on this podium. It’s a great day to be a Wildcat.</p>

<p>I hope everybody is proud at home, and I’ll be forever living the TCC principle, Trust, Commitment, Care, that you taught me from day one in everything that I do. So thank you so much for your guidance and your challenging me every day, and for my first workout, waving that white flag, asking me if I wanted to surrender. I looked you in your face and said, no, “I’m going to keep fighting,” and I’ve been rolling ever since. So thank you very much.</p>

<p>To the Warriors organization: Joe, Peter, Rick, Bob, all of your staff in the front office, everybody that works upstairs in the offices, we play for a first‑class organization, and you have to appreciate that. I love coming to work every day because of how you treat us. What you’ve done to change the culture around here and just your leadership, so thank you very much for all your hard work and the decisions you’ve made along the way.</p>

<p>Obviously, we’ve got another award, Executive of the Year, we should have had two more with Coach of the Year and obviously Draymond as Defensive Player of the Year. But I mean, just the way we are represented across the nation now and across the world, everybody has a hand in it, and you guys are leading that charge. So thank you very much. I love playing for you guys.</p>

<p>I’ve got to talk about this guy really quick. Eric Housen who is in the back; he’s going to be really embarrassed. We’ve got the best equipment manager in the league; I think these guys would agree. You probably have a more official title than that, but the work you do day‑in and day‑out taking care of us players, sometimes we’re a little needy, sometimes we might need an extra pair of socks and it’s our fault that we lost them. But we appreciate everything that you do.</p>

<p>Walking in the locker room, I see a new pair of shoes sitting in front of me with a Sharpie in there laced up, those little things mean a lot. It starts your game‑day routine. There are little things you might take for granted day‑in and day‑out, but I want you to know we appreciate everything you do. I know you’re proud to be part of this organization, and you’ve been here probably the longest, so well done, my man.</p>

<p>Larry Riley is here. Where are you, Larry? Are you here? He’s the reason I’m here. He drafted me. He saw potential in me coming out of college, along with Don Nelson, making those decisions. You’re a big reason why I’m here, taking a chance on a scrawny little kid from a mid‑major school. So just wanted to say thank you for believing in me. Crazy how far we’ve come in six years, but just thank you, man. I can’t thank you enough for that decision.</p>

<p>All the rest of the Warriors staff: Dan Martinez, Raymond Ridder who we see every day, I see Lisa over there, Brett, Matt, all you guys that handle our affairs on and off the court. You make us look good, and we thank you for all the work that you do to put us out there to get our stories out there, allow us to help in the community, all of that. It means a lot. The work that we’ve been able to do, and just spreading across Dub Nation, so thank you guys for being there.</p>

<p>Speaking of Dub Nation, I say it all the time, we’ve got the best fans in the league, man.</p>

<p>Speaking of the year I was drafted, we were awful. We were awful. We won, I think, 23 games my rookie year and a couple years after that finally cracked the ceiling and made the playoffs. You walked in our arena back in ‘09 or even before that, and you wouldn’t know this is a losing team that was well outside of the playoff chase by the way the energy in the arena was every single night.</p>

<p>So thank you, guys, for the support every single night for having the best home court advantage. We’re going to need you tomorrow night as well to bring that spirit. We love playing for you guys and we want to make you guys proud by bringing home a championship. And that is the ultimate goal. This is a minor checkpoint on that mission. So we’re going to make a strong push at this thing and protect Warriors’ ground in everything that we do.</p>

<p>Where’s Ralph Walker at? Where’s Ralph? He’s guarding the door (laughing). Ralph, our head of security, I’ve seen a lot of you the last three years. You’re at every event, every practice, every game. You’re our eyes when we don’t have them, and we appreciate you putting yourself out there anytime we need you being there for us. So we appreciate everything that you’ve done, and I like that vest. It’s nice.</p>

<p>Lastly, the people that are here, my team at Octagon. I’ve got the strongest team behind me, and I appreciate you guys being there from day one. It’s crazy. Jeff in particular, can you imagine this, man? You were there when my dad was playing, and came under the umbrella, and you represent me well, and I appreciate everything that you’ve done– and your whole team. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>So that’s all the people in particular. But when I found out that I had won MVP yesterday, I really didn’t know what to do. We left the game, we were going back to the house, and I have a bunch of family in town, and they were being really weird from the time I got out of the car, like asking me weird questions, pulling me off to different areas of the house, and I couldn’t really figure it out. Then my brother called and he was like, “Hey, you need to check something out in your closet. Can you show me some shoes?” And I was like okay, cool. So we walk in the back and there my whole family are with their shirts on that my team at Under Armour made, and I couldn’t really read what it said at first.</p>

<p>They all walk in, and they have their cameras out with the cheesiest smiles you could ever imagine like just, with their phones. And I’m like looking at Seth, I’m looking at everybody like what’s going on? And they got something on my shirt? I don’t know what’s going on. So I looked, and my sister kind of points down. I’m like looking, and they all had how they’re related to me. My husband is SC30, and at the bottom in yellow font it said, “MVP”. So I couldn’t read it at first. So I took a further glance. I’m like, “Wait, what? For real?” And I just break down crying and hugging, and it was a great moment that I’ll remember for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>But after that, I kind of went and sat in the chair in the corner and thought about the journey. It was an emotional ten minutes just sitting there, thinking about all the people that have helped me along the way. Every little part of the story that made a difference in my life, and…</p>

<p>There are obviously good times and bad times. Times I wanted to shut it down and times where you realize that all the hard work that you put into it was worth it, and it just made me realize how blessed and grateful I really am to be in this position on this platform to be able to impact so many people across the world by just trying to be myself.</p>

<p>My wife and I were sitting and trying to think about what I was going to say today and kind of what the message would be. We came up with four ideals that describe the journey the best way I know how and that’s faith, passion, drive, and will. And I’ll try to explain the best way I can. You guys will be a part of one of those.</p>

<p>Obviously, my faith, I wanted to use this opportunity to shed light on who I am and what drives me to play the way that I do. I do a little sign on the court every time I make a shot or good pass, and I pound my chest and point to the sky, and that symbolizes that I have a heart for God. Something my mom and I came up with in college, and I do it every time I step on the floor as a reminder of who I’m playing for.</p>

<p>People should know who I represent and why I am who I am, and that is because of my Lord and Savior. So I can’t say that enough.</p>

<p>The passion part is where my love for the game was bread. I kind of got the ultimate paradox for a story. I’m the son of a 16‑year NBA veteran, I remember a lot of his career, I was blessed to have a family that never really struggled when I was growing up thanks to my dad and his career, we had the means to do a lot growing up. You would think that my future was set based on that fact, and that couldn’t be farther from the truth.</p>

<p>I was always the smallest kid on my team. When it comes to basketball, I was always the smallest kid on my team. I had a terrible, ugly, catapult shot from the time I was 14 because I wasn’t strong enough to shoot over my head, and I had to reconstruct that over the summer and it was the worst three months of my life. You’d think there are no hurdles or obstacles that I had to overcome, but even when I got to high school I wasn’t ranked. I wasn’t ranked, I wasn’t highly touted as a high school prospect. I had nobody really running, knocking on my door saying “Please, please, please come play for our school,” until Coach McKillop called.</p>

<p>Everything happens for a reason, and there is a story to everything. If you take time to realize what your dream is and what you really want in life– no matter what it is, whether it’s sports or in other fields– you have to realize that there is always work to do, and you want to be the hardest working person in whatever you do, and you put yourself in a position to be successful. And you have to have a passion about what you do. Basketball was mine, and that’s what’s carried me to this point.</p>

<p>Part of that passion is the drive to keep pushing on, and that’s with who you’re surrounded by. These 14 guys sitting on this stage right here. You guys push me every single day. I’m going to go through kind of just talking about you individually because you need to be highlighted as a part of this process, and as a part of the team that we built, and a reason why this trophy is it sitting here, and hopefully another trophy will be sitting here in a few months.</p>

<p>LB, the Brazilian Blur, just seeing how fast you are right now, I mean, I can imagine when you were playing with that other MVP back in the day. Your spirit in the locker room, you’re the funniest dude on this team. Maybe arguably, but you’re up there. You just bring it every single day, man, whether you’re playing 20 minutes, playing five minutes, whatever you’re called on to do, you’re the ultimate professional, and that goes a long way. I respect you so much for how you’ve handled this season and just thank you for being who you are.</p>

<p>S. Dot, man, your journey is crazy. I mean, everybody knows where you’ve been and the fight that you’ve had. I love playing with you, because you’re low maintenance. You don’t need anything. You just go out there and hoop, and you do what you do. We can count on you every single night to be ready to play and help us win games. Lot of times it might not show up eye‑popping numbers on the stat sheet, but you help us win games every single night man and are a big part of why we are who we are.</p>

<p>B. Rush, I’m going to call you your nickname on live TV (laughing). It’s your second go around with the Warriors, and obviously it’s a little different than the last time you were here. But you’re also the guy that when we come in every single day, whether it’s practice or whether it’s games, I know you’re locked in and ready to go.</p>

<p>I know it’s been tough finding your niche with this group, but your personality and the way that you play and the way that you push us in practice gets us ready. There is going to be probably an opportunity for you to help us down the road, and we’re going to need you. Just the way that you handle that situation is very impressive, and I appreciate that. I know all the guys do as well.</p>

<p>Speights, Mo Speights, Mo Buckets, your spirit on the court is contagious, man. You just have fun playing the game. You’re the biggest shooting guard in the league and you wear the lowest low tops on the team.</p>

<p>So it’s like the biggest ‑‑ I’m confused when I watch you play, but I know when I come off the pick‑and‑roll, you’re going to knock down that shot. You’re going to get the crowd hyped, talk to the other team, and you’re just going to enjoy playing basketball, and what that means and that competitive nature about you is special. So keep doing what you’re doing.</p>

<p>Dre’, Andre, we probably talk about golf more than we talk about basketball. But the conversation we had two years ago at Oracle Arena half court, I remember that.</p>

<p>Man, I’m about to cry on that one. That meant a lot to me, because basketball’s important to me, but my family and my faith are ten times more important to me and you recognized that. And what you said on the court, I’ll never forget that.</p>

<p>Obviously, the decision after that summer was big, but, man, that meant a lot to me, and I just want to say thank you for that. Appreciate who you are as a player and as a person. We had some crazy conversations when you’re in the locker room, but you’re the ultimate vet, ultimate professional, and I appreciate you.</p>

<p>Swag Ezeli, you are, man, that was a rough year last year, but you’ve come back strong, man. You always had that determination and that drive that you can go out there and do anything on the court. My favorite part about Festus is when I come off the pick‑and‑roll and sometimes they’ll chat me or double team me, and I don’t throw him the ball, he gets so mad at me because he wants that ball in that paint. He wants to drop step and get to his left shoulder and hit that right hook.</p>

<p>But sometimes I can’t give him the ball. He’s like, Yo, did you see me on that last play? And I’m like, yeah, I saw you, I just couldn’t get you the ball. I’m not looking you ‑‑ well, sometimes I look you up. But I’m not ‑‑ (laughing).</p>

<p>You made a play last night that I got more excited about your play last night than any other play in the game. So that’s just our relationship and I love it. Your will to keep getting better is amazing. It’s going to take you a long way in the league. So keep being who you are. But turn that swag down just a little bit though.</p>

<p>Draymond, man, you set the greatest screens, man. You and Bos ‑‑ he’s calling himself the screen. We got a little joke that D‑League came up with. Every time I walk around with these two guys they call themselves Steph Curry and the Screen Setters (laughing).</p>

<p>But your spirit, man, you’re the voice of this team. I try to lead by example and try to be as consistent as possible, but your voice and your spirit every single day whether it’s going well, whether you’re making shots, missing shots, it doesn’t matter. You’re the same person, and we can count on that every single night, and that’s what makes you who you are.</p>

<p>As a part of your story and your journey, our text message conversation last night just put in perspective just how crazy this whole situation is, man.</p>

<p>And Joe? Looks to Joe Lacob. Smiles. Points to Draymond Green. Shrugs theatrically. Shrugs some more. Smiles.</p>

<p>Not many people knew who I was talking about, but we’ll leave that.</p>

<p>Going on over to this side. H.B., the Black Falcon laughing, oh, man. From day one you’re my locker mate. You’re always to my right. I’ve just seen you kind of mature into your game. You were obviously crazy young when you came into the league out of Carolina. But I remember the first time I met you was at Chris Paul’s camp in Wake Forest we went. You were looking for a foam roller out of the trunk of some car because you wanted to take care of your body.</p>

<p>I’m like I’ve never seen a high school player actually want a foam roll or stretch or do any of that, and this guy was like not going to go on the court unless he found that foam roller to take back to the hotel, and things don’t change, bro.</p>

<p>You are wise beyond your years and a huge catalyst for our success the last three years. What you did your rookie year in the playoffs and just getting better and every single year has been huge for us. You’ve got my vote when you run for whatever office after you’re done playing. You can probably ask the mayor of Oakland right there for some advice. But you’ve got my vote, for sure.</p>

<p>Just Holler, Justin Holiday, this is our first year together. But your story and how you’ve had to fight to make the team and to establish yourself as an NBA player is amazing. Your confidence when you get on the floor, you want to make plays, you want to do your best every single night, and that’s inspiring, for sure.</p>

<p>You’ve been there, a huge presence for us all year, and I know that this has been a great year for you, and we want to capitalize on it. I want to see you do some great things, so keep working. Keep doing what you’re doing. You’re a special player that deserves to be on this level, and I’m just proud of the way you’ve done what you’ve been able to do.</p>

<p>My splash bro, whew, Klay Thompson. Man. You’re the quietest guy. You’re actually a lot better than you used to be. But you’re definitely a quiet guy that every year I’ve gotten to know.</p>

<p>You can lock up any guard in this league, and you made my job easy. When I come off the floor and I see you on other wings dishing balls and those going up, and most of the time it’s going in. So hopefully we have a long future together, man, and we can do some special things and hopefully be the best back courts to ever play this game, and that is something that is our mission. We should challenge each other every day in that regard and make it happen.</p>

<p>A.B., Andrew Bogut, he’s our eraser, man. When he first got traded to our team, I was hurt and he was hurt, and the team went on a road trip and we were left behind for treatment, and I took him and picked him up at the hotel and got in my car and drove to my apartment in San Francisco.</p>

<p>It’s a little small, 2‑bedroom spot, and I was kind of nervous to show him my spot because it’s basically you’re not going in my bedroom, so you’re going in that one little sitting area. And he’s 7’2″, and I had the smallest couch. So he’s sitting with his knees in his throat watching the game.</p>

<p>But ever since then, I see how much basketball means to you, how hard you work through injuries, through ups and downs, to getting ready for big moments. And I know this is a big year for you being healthy and being able to contribute at a high level every single night to help our team. So, man you make us look good on the defensive end, and the way that you challenge whoever you’re facing is impressive. I appreciate you put your body on the line every single night, and that makes us better, so thank you. Respect.</p>

<p>D. Lee, man, we are the OGs of this team. We’ve been here the longest, since 2010. We’ve always had these little inside jokes that nobody else knows about because nobody else was here. And it’s special. You’re an All‑Star, and a high‑caliber player that’s done some big things in your career and this year is no different.</p>

<p>The way we talked about it yesterday, the way that you handle it with the ultimate goal in mind, being ready every single night when you’re called upon, that is as huge a part of our success as anything because it could go the other way quickly. So, you’re a great friend.</p>

<p>The change that’s been happening in this organization, I think me and you appreciate it the most. And we’ve got to finish this thing off so that we can get that ring and really celebrate.</p>

<p>McAdoo and Kuz, I don’t mean to lump you two together, but you’re the two new guys. Obviously, Kuz has been in a little longer, the Santa Cruz D‑League champs. Appreciate all your hard work coming in every single day, working before and after practice. That sets the tone for our practice when we see guys out there getting it in. You make us want to get out there and work.</p>

<p>So thank you so much for who you are and being who you are. You’re a huge part of this team, just your spirit and your presence every single day, whether you play or not, you’re always into it and we appreciate that. You’ve both got some great careers ahead of you. Phew, got through that.</p>

<p>I go through that long spiel about my teammates, just to say that we share a lot of memories, and this is just a snap shot of the journey. We’ll remember this year no matter how it finishes, really. But we have a huge goal in mind this year, and we’ll be able to talk about it for years to come.</p>

<p>Every time we think of this moment we’ll talk about it and moments that hopefully will happen in a couple of months, it will all mean so much to us. How much sacrifice we’ve put into it, how much work, just the consistency that it takes to get to where we are. It takes all 14 guys. You can’t have one bad apple in this equation, and we don’t.</p>

<p>So we’re truly grateful. I’m grateful to have this team behind me. This is not possible without you guys. I want everybody to get a fingerprint on that so I can remember who I rolled with during this year, and thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>All right. I’ve been long‑winded, but this is the last part. I’ve talked about faith, passion, and the drive with the guys that I’ve been around and the guys that surround me every single day. But a part of that is having the will to succeed. Knowing that you’ve put the work in and have the confidence to let it show. What I tell people is be the best version of yourself in anything that you do.</p>

<p>You don’t have to live anybody else’s story. Sometimes people make it seem like you have to have certain prerequisites or a crazy life story in order to be successful in this world. But the truth is you really don’t. It doesn’t matter where you come from, what you have or don’t have, what you lack or what you have too much of, but all you need to have is faith in God, an undying passion for what you do and what you choose to do in this life, and a relentless drive and the will to do whatever it takes to be successful in whatever you put your mind to.</p>

<p>Make sure you live in the moment and work your butt off every single day, and I hope I inspire people all around the world to just be themselves, be humble, and be grateful for all the blessings in your life. I’m truly honored to be your MVP this year. Thank you very much.” - Stephen Curry</p>
